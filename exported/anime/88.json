{"AnimeName":"Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei","AnimeDescription":"Magic has been recognized and analyzed over the last century. What was once the realm of folklore and tales is now a formalized practice and applied science. And magicians&mdash;those capable of using magic to its fullest potential&mdash;hold the power to change the world on every conceivable level.\r\n\r\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei follows Tatsuya Shiba, a magician who excels at magical combat and technical knowledge, and Miyuki Shiba, his sister and the heir of the Yotsuba family who Tatsuya is assigned to protect, as they begin their first day at a school for magicians known as First High School. However, the school segregates the students based on their entrance exam scores, with the best students (known as &quot;Blooms&quot;) being assigned to First Course and the worst students (known as &quot;Weeds&quot;) being assigned to the Second Course. Due to the exams not accounting for his talents, Tatsuya is placed in the Second Course, making him an irregular student within the magic high school.","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/20785/Mahouka_Koukou_no_Rettousei?q=Mahouka%20Kouko","AnimeGenres":["Magic","Romance","School","Sci-Fi","Supernatural"],"AnimeStudios":["Madhouse"],"AnimeRating":7.78,"id":88,"direction_from":82,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
