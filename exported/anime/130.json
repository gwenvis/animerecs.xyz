{"AnimeName":"Amagi Brilliant Park","AnimeDescription":"Kanie Seiya, a smart and extremely narcissistic high school student, believes that the beautiful but reserved Sento Isuzu has invited him on a date at an amusement park called Amagi Brilliant Park. Much to his chagrin, not only is the location a run-down facility, the supposed date is merely a recruitment tour where Sento and Princess Latifa Fleuranza, the owner of the theme park, ask him to become the park&#039;s new manager. Their cause for desperation? As stipulated in a land-use contract, Amagi has less than three months to meet a quota of 500,000 guests, or the park will be closed for good and the land redeveloped by a greedy real-estate company.\r\n\r\nSeiya is won over by the revelation that Amagi is no ordinary amusement park; many of its employees are Maple Landers&mdash;mysterious magical beings who live in the human world and are nourished by the energy created by people having fun. Entrusted with the hopes and dreams of this far-off enchanted land, Seiya must now use his many skills to bring Amagi back on its feet, or watch it crumble before his eyes.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/22147/Amagi_Brilliant_Park?q=Amagi%20Brilliant%20Park","AnimeGenres":["Comedy","Magic"],"AnimeStudios":["Kyoto Animation"],"AnimeRating":7.72,"id":130,"direction_from":126,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
