{"AnimeName":"Tamako Market","AnimeDescription":"Inside the Usagiyama Shopping District lies an eccentric but close-knit community of business owners. Tamako Kitashirakawa, a clumsy though adorable teenage girl, belongs to a family of mochi bakers who own a quaint shop called Tama-ya. One day, Tamako stumbles upon a talking bird that presents himself as royalty from a distant land. Dera Mochimazzi, as he calls himself, states that he&rsquo;s seeking a bride for his country&rsquo;s prince. Intent on his mission, Dera follows Tamako home and develops an addiction to mochi, becoming painfully overweight and subsequently unable to fly back to his homeland; thus, he takes up residence with Tamako&#039;s family and becomes the community&rsquo;s beloved mascot.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Tamako&#039;s friend, Mochizou Ooji, continues to hide his true feelings for her. Their fathers are fierce mochi rivals, but will it be enough to drive a wedge between Tamako and Mochizou? And just what will happen to Dera&#039;s task of finding his prince&rsquo;s destined bride?\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/16417/Tamako_Market?q=Tamako%20Market","AnimeGenres":["Comedy","Slice of Life"],"AnimeStudios":["Kyoto Animation"],"AnimeRating":7.35,"id":239,"direction_from":233,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
