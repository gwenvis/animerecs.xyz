{"AnimeName":"Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso","AnimeDescription":"Music accompanies the path of the human metronome, the prodigious pianist Kousei Arima. But after the passing of his mother, Saki Arima, Kousei falls into a downward spiral, rendering him unable to hear the sound of his own piano.\r\n \r\nTwo years later, Kousei still avoids the piano, leaving behind his admirers and rivals, and lives a colorless life alongside his friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari. However, everything changes when he meets a beautiful violinist, Kaori Miyazono, who stirs up his world and sets him on a journey to face music again.\r\n\r\nBased on the manga series of the same name, Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso approaches the story of Kousei&#039;s recovery as he discovers that music is more than playing each note perfectly, and a single melody can bring in the fresh spring air of April.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso?q=Your%20lie%20in%20april","AnimeGenres":["Drama","Music","Romance","School","Shounen"],"AnimeStudios":["A-1 Pictures"],"AnimeRating":8.93,"id":196,"direction_from":193,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
