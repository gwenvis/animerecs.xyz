{"AnimeName":"Zankyou no Terror","AnimeDescription":"Life&rsquo;s mundane routine is brought to a screeching halt in modern Japan with the advent of anonymous bombings.

Parallel to these events, two young men named Nine and Twelve instate themselves among the local school population.\r\n\r\nZankyou no Terror follows Nine and Twelve as they send Japan plummeting into chaos with their goal being to help &quot;wake up the world&quot;. It explores the psychological and physical repercussions of buried secrets, all too easily identified within today&rsquo;s world. There are no &quot;good guys&quot; and &quot;bad guys&quot;. There are those seeking change, those trying to prevent exposing their dirty little secrets, and overworked police officers stuck in the middle trying to protect the citizens.","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/23283/Zankyou_no_Terror?q=Zankyou%20no%20Terror","AnimeGenres":["Psychological","Thriller"],"AnimeStudios":["MAPPA"],"AnimeRating":8.28,"id":56,"direction_from":55,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
