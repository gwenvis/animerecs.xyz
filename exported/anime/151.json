{"AnimeName":"Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu","AnimeDescription":"Kyon, your typical high school student, has long given up his belief in the supernatural. However, upon meeting Haruhi Suzumiya, he quickly finds out that it is the supernatural that she is interested in&mdash;aliens, time travelers, and espers among other things. When Haruhi laments about the lack of intriguing clubs around school, Kyon inspires Haruhi to form her own club. As a result, the SOS Brigade is formed, a club which specializes in all that is the supernatural.\r\n\r\nMuch to his chagrin, Kyon, along with the silent bookworm, Yuki Nagato, the shy and timid Mikuru Asahina, and the perpetually smiling Itsuki Koizumi, are recruited as members. The story follows the crazy adventures that these four endure under their whimsical leader, Haruhi. The story is based on the light novels by Nagaru Tanigawa.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/849/Suzumiya_Haruhi_no_Yuuutsu?q=Haruhi","AnimeGenres":["Comedy","Mystery","Parody","School","Sci-Fi","Slice of Life"],"AnimeStudios":["Kyoto Animation"],"AnimeRating":8.09,"id":151,"direction_from":146,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
