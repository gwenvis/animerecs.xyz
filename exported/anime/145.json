{"AnimeName":"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou","AnimeDescription":"Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou chronicles the daily lives of Tadakuni, Hidenori, and Yoshitake; students at Sanada North High School, an all-boys academy. While their lives are rather run-of-the-mill, their overactive imaginations ensure that it is anything but boring!\r\n\r\nThe boys will have arguments ranging from the effectiveness of wearing skirts (do you really need to shave your legs?) to the best way of getting a girlfriend (just grab her by the hand and run!). Nothing they discuss or do is immune from their out of control antics. Even something as simple as sitting by a riverbank at sunset can turn into a melodramatic moment befitting the best soap opera in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou!","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/11843/Danshi_Koukousei_no_Nichijou?q=Daily%20life%20of%20","AnimeGenres":["Comedy","School","Shounen","Slice of Life"],"AnimeStudios":["Sunrise"],"AnimeRating":8.36,"id":145,"direction_from":134,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
