{"AnimeName":"Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei","AnimeDescription":"Nozomu Itoshiki is a high school teacher so pessimistic that even the smallest of misfortunes can send him into a pit of raging despair; some of these &quot;catastrophes&quot; even lead to suicide attempts. Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei is a satirical slice-of-life comedy set in the modern day, covering various aspects of Japanese life and culture through Nozomu and his interactions with his students: Kiri Komori, a recluse who refuses to leave the school; Abiru Kobushi, an enigma who frequently arrives to class with severe and mysterious injuries; the hyper-optimistic Kafuuka Fuura, Nozomu&#039;s polar opposite; and several other unusual girls, all of whom are just as eccentric as their teacher.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/2605/Sayonara_Zetsubou_Sensei?q=Sayonara%20Zetsu","AnimeGenres":["Comedy","Parody","School"],"AnimeStudios":["Shaft"],"AnimeRating":8.05,"id":142,"direction_from":133,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
