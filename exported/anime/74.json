{"AnimeName":"Toaru Majutsu no Index","AnimeDescription":"Academy City, Japan, is at the forefront of science. Besides being 30 years ahead of the world technologically, more than three-fourths of this peculiar city&#039;s population consists of students developing their psychic abilities as espers in various institutions. Among these students is Touma Kamijou, a high school boy with the lowest psychic rank of zero, but with a mysterious power no scientist can understand: &quot;Imagine Breaker,&quot; which allows him to negate other supernatural abilities.\r\n \r\nThis, however, doesn&#039;t affect Kamijou&#039;s life in the least as he plays his role as a regular teenager; that is, until he meets the strange Index Librorum Prohibitorum, a young girl who has memorized the entire forbidden grimoires, and now a dangerous organization is hunting Index down. With several magicians looking to harm the girl, Kamijou will defend his new companion at all costs as he discovers a strange new realm of the supernatural.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/4654/Toaru_Majutsu_no_Index?q=A%20certain%20","AnimeGenres":["Action","Magic","Sci-Fi","Super Power"],"AnimeStudios":["J.C.Staff"],"AnimeRating":7.72,"id":74,"direction_from":70,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
