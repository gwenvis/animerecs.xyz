{"AnimeName":"Katanagatari","AnimeDescription":"In an Edo-era Japan lush with a variety of sword-fighting styles, Shichika Yasuri practices the most unique one: Kyotouryuu, a technique in which the user&#039;s own body is wielded as a blade. The enigmatic seventh head of the Kyotouryuu school, Shichika lives quietly in exile with his sister Nanami until one day&mdash;the wildly ambitious strategist Togame barges into their lives.\r\n\r\nTogame brazenly requests that Shichika help in her mission to collect twelve unique swords, known as the &quot;Deviant Blades,&quot; for the shogunate. Shichika accepts, interested in the girl herself rather than petty politics, and thus sets out on a journey. Standing in their way are the fierce wielders of these legendary weapons as well as other power-hungry entities who seek to thwart Togame&#039;s objective. In order to prevail against their enemies, the duo must become an unbreakable team as they forge ahead on a path of uncertainty and peril.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/6594/Katanagatari?q=Katana","AnimeGenres":["Action","Adventure","Historical","Martial Arts"],"AnimeStudios":["White Fox"],"AnimeRating":8.5,"id":23,"direction_from":17,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
