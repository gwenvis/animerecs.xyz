{"AnimeName":"Death Parade","AnimeDescription":"After death, there is no heaven or hell, only a bar that stands between reincarnation and oblivion. There the attendant will, one after another, challenge pairs of the recently deceased to a random game in which their fate of either ascending into reincarnation or falling into the void will be wagered. Whether it&#039;s bowling, darts, air hockey, or anything in between, each person&#039;s true nature will be revealed in a ghastly parade of death and memories, dancing to the whims of the bar&#039;s master. Welcome to Quindecim, where Decim, arbiter of the afterlife, awaits!\r\n\r\nDeath Parade expands upon the original one-shot intended to train young animators. It follows yet more people receiving judgment&mdash;until a strange, black-haired guest causes Decim to begin questioning his own rulings.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/28223/Death_Parade?q=Death%20Parade","AnimeGenres":["Drama","Game","Mystery","Psychological","Thriller"],"AnimeStudios":["Madhouse"],"AnimeRating":8.36,"id":269,"direction_from":266,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
