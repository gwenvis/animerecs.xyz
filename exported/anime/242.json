{"AnimeName":"Kyoukai no Kanata","AnimeDescription":"Mirai Kuriyama is the sole survivor of a clan of Spirit World warriors with the power to employ their blood as weapons. As such, Mirai is tasked with hunting down and killing &quot;youmu&quot;&mdash;creatures said to be the manifestation of negative human emotions. One day, while deep in thought on the school roof, Mirai comes across Akihito Kanbara, a rare half-breed of youmu in human form. In a panicked state, she plunges her blood saber into him only to realize that he&#039;s an immortal being. From then on, the two form an impromptu friendship that revolves around Mirai constantly trying to kill Akihito, in an effort to boost her own wavering confidence as a Spirit World warrior. Eventually, Akihito also manages to convince her to join the Literary Club, which houses two other powerful Spirit World warriors, Hiroomi and Mitsuki Nase.\r\n\r\nAs the group&#039;s bond strengthens, however, so does the tenacity of the youmu around them. Their misadventures will soon turn into a fight for survival as the inevitable release of the most powerful youmu, Beyond the Boundary, approaches.\r\n\r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]","AnimePosterPath":null,"MalLink":"http://myanimelist.net/anime/18153/Kyoukai_no_Kanata?q=Kyoukai%20no%20","AnimeGenres":["Fantasy","Slice of Life","Supernatural"],"AnimeStudios":["Kyoto Animation"],"AnimeRating":7.88,"id":242,"direction_from":241,"direction_to":[],"ConnectedAnime":[],"isAnimeObject":true,"leadsToAnime":false}
